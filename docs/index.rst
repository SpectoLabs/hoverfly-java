What is Hoverfly Java?
######################

`Hoverfly <http://hoverfly.io>`_ is a lightweight service virtualisation tool which allows you to stub / simulate HTTP(S) services. It is a proxy written in `Go <https://golang.org/>`_ which responds to HTTP(S) requests with stored responses, pretending to be it's real counterpart.

It enables you to get around common testing problems caused by external dependencies, such as non-deterministic data, flakiness, not yet implemented API's, licensing fees, slow tests and more.

**Hoverfly Java** is a native language binding which gives you an expressive API for managing Hoverfly in Java.  It gives you a Hoverfly class which abstracts away the binary and API calls, a :ref:`dsl` for creating simulations, and a :ref:`junit` integration for using it within JUnit tests.

Hoverfly Java is developed and maintained by `SpectoLabs <https://specto.io>`_.
